# SpeechTone-Erie

This repositoray is based on the original Erie declarative grammar (https://github.com/see-mike-out/erie-web) and extends it to include the speech-based mark, SpeechTone. 

To build the extended library, run: 

```
npm i
npm run build
```

Please see the demo project for a detailed README for how to utilize SpeechTone.
